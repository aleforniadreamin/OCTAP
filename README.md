## Purpose of Project
The purpose of the Operation Code Transition Assistance Program (OCTAP) is to provide guidance for active duty and/or veterans who wish to transition into the tech industry. OCTAP will leverage its extensive network, as well as external resources, to create a structured self-paced curriculum that members can take to supplement their career transition. Training tracks will be created for members to prepare them to enter four main fields in the tech industry: 
- Full Stack Development
- Data Science
- Cyber Security 
- UX/UI | Product Management

An addition to providing material related to the specialized courses, the curriculum should also cover subjects/resources that benefit the member outside of the "programming" world, such as:
- Self care
- Mental health
- Housing resources
- Community resources
- Soft skills:
  - Networking 101
  - Professional development subjects (Resume, LinkedIn, etc.)

OCTAP was created to keep true of Operation Codes mission of helping the military community "thrive in their careers to code a better future". Members of Operation Code noticed a trend of service members feeling overwhelmed in their transition to the tech industry. OCTAP strives to address this issue by reaching service members well before they transition and provide them with the right tools to have the best chance of a successful transition. The secondary goal is to provide guidance for veterans already separated and assist the large veteran community who wish to enter the tech industry. The amount of information that is available can be overwhelming for inexperienced members, so OCTAP plans to provide the resources that offer the highest value for its members. 

## Defining Project Success Criteria
The success of OCTAP will be measured by how many members are able to find meaningful employment in the field of their track, or find meaningful employment after transition.However, OCTAP isn't intended as a job placement service, instead it represents one tool a member can utilize as they strive for a civilian career they can be proud of. 

## High Level Project Description
Creating a structured self-paced curriculum requires OCTAP to utilize already available resources and not "reinvent the wheel". The key word is "structured", and the value of OCTAP is providing "what" to study and "when" to study said subject, alongside guidance from experienced members. Curriculums will be based on training track member chooses and material will be accessed through Github repositories. The following will be a sample training track for Full Stack Development.
