## Purpose of Project
The purpose of the Operation Code Transition Assistance Program (OCTAP) is to provide guidance for active duty and/or veterans who wish to transition into the tech industry. OCTAP will leverage its extensive network, as well as external resources, to create a structured self-paced curriculum that members can take to supplement their career transition. Training tracks will be created for members to prepare them to enter four main fields in the tech industry: 
- Full Stack Development
- Data Science
- Cyber Security 
- UX/UI | Product Management.

OCTAP was created to keep true of Operation Codes mission of helping the military community "thrive in their careers to code a better future". Members of Operation Code noticed a trend of service members feeling overwhelmed in their transition to the tech industry. OCTAP strives to address this issue by reaching service members well before they transition and provide them with the right tools to have the best chance of a successful transition. The secondary goal is to provide guidance for veterans already separated and assist the large veteran community who wish to enter the tech industry. The amount of information that is available can be overwhelming for inexperienced members, so OCTAP plans to provide the resources that offer the highest value for its members. 

## Defining Project Success Criteria
The success of OCTAP will be measured by how many members are able to find meaningful employment in the field of their track, or find meaningful employment after transition.However, OCTAP isn't intended as a job placement service, instead it represents one tool a member can utilize as they strive for a civilian career they can be proud of. 

## High Level Project Description
Creating a structured self-paced curriculum requires OCTAP to utilize already available resources and not "reinvent the wheel". The key word is "structured", and the value of OCTAP is providing "what" to study and "when" to study said subject, alongside guidance from experienced members. Curriculums will be based on training track member chooses and material will be accessed through Github repositories. The following will be a sample training track for Full Stack Development:
- **Full Stack Development 000 (Introduction):**
  - This section will cover what exactly "Full Stack Development" is, and the broad overview of the field as well as requirements
  - Goal of this section is to provide enough context about the industry and make sure the member knows exactly what they are signing up for
  - Additional subjects found in this repo will be:
    - Skills/languages required for Full Stack Development
    - Distinguishing between front-end and back-end
    - Types of industries a web developer can work in 
    - Salaries, lifestyle, career progression, etc. 

- **Full Stack Development 100 (Fundamentals):**
  - This section will cover the fundamental skills required to be a web developer and introduce the member to tutorials that cover the basics (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Section will be heavy on the front-end of web development.
  - Tutorials that slowly build the skills of the member will be listed: 
    - https://www.freecodecamp.org/
    - https://www.theodinproject.com/
  - In addition to tutorials, this phase will introduce other crucial steps a member can take, such as creating a LinkedIn, resume, and Github. 
    - Member will also be instructed other tasks such as researching potential companies or leveraging available resources available to them (Skillbridge, etc.) and communicating goals with their command

- **Full Stack Development 200 (Intermediate):**
  - This section will introduce resources that build upon the foundational skills and provide resources that introduce more technologies. This section will cover the various technologies and skill required for back-end development. 
  - Section 200 will also introduce various routes that a member can take such as a coding bootcamp or university degree 
    - Depending on the choice will have different steps they can take
  - Intermediate tutorials, resources, and steps

- **Full Stack Development 300 (Advanced):** 
  - During this phase a member will have a clear understanding of web development as well as the resources available to them and decide what actions to take. 
    - Members that want to take advantage of command sponsored programs, coding bootcamps, college route will take the necessary steps to achieve it
  - Advanced tutorials, resources, and steps
