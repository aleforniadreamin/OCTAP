# Video Ideas for Operation Code
We have a community of experienced developers. Let's leverage our talented members and allow members to record information videos on a variety of subjects. Creating more videos allows for: 1) more opportunity to share Operation Code with the world 2) recognize talented members within the community

* How to use the resources API
* How to improve your LinkedIn profile
* Random little "hip pocket" videos covering all sorts of topics related around programming recorded by other members of the community 
* What is Scrum and Agile? 
* How to negotiate a salary? 
* How to deploy a web app on Django? 
* How I interview applicants (from a hiring managers perspective)
* How to search for a new position? 
  

Perhaps create a sign up sheet where members can sign up with their proposed ideas. 

Have Operation Code members employed in companies give Zoom talks about what its like to be employed and best practices.
